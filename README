Version 1.2.0 of InfTools


Makes tools never break and has permissions support! You never have to worry about crafting a new tool or losing that rare enchantment, ever again!

How to use:

First make sure that the player, or group has the proper permission node

inftools.inftool
Then all you have to do is use the "/inftool" command to turn on infinite tools.

If you want to turn it off, then just use the "/inftool" command again.
